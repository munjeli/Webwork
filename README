I'm initializing a git repo to store the code I'm writing for my website. 

This isn't any kind of a critical project, rather, it's an opportunity to share code among students at school and give us some experience with git. I do have a jQuery plugin for my site that I'm working on that might be handy for some people, so those files will show up here.
